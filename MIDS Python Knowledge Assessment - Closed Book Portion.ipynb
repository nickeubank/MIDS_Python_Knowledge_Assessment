    "For this portion of the exam, please **DO NOT** use your computers, just write your answers with a pen or pencil. \n",

    "This is not a test; it is a diagnostic knowledge assessment. It's purpose is to see (a) what you have absorbed from summer coursework, *and* (b) whether you are prepared to skip Practical Data Science I. To accomplish this, the assessment includes questions that cover much of the material that will be covered in 690-02 -- material you were *not* taught over the summer. \n",
    "\n",
    "These questions are designed to identify students with prior experience with Python who don't need to take 690-02, so I don't expect most students to be able to do those portion of the exam. I don't think it would be unreasonable for a student without prior Python experience who worked hard this summer to only correctly answer about 30% of the questions here -- and that's **fine!**. Again, the point of this assessment is not to grade you, but rather to help me figure out what you know so that I can tailor my course materials *to meet you where you are*, and best support your training moving forward. \n",
    "\n",
    "That also means that if you don't know how to do something, **please don't spend all your time trying to figure it out!**. There *will* be questions you don't know how to do, so when you find one, just move on!"
