    "Welcome to the MIDS Knowledge Assessment. The purpose of this assessment is to give MIDS instructors as sense of your current comfort level with Python following our summer courses and in-person BootCamp. \n",
    "\n",
    "## This is **not** a test, and this is **not** graded. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will find questions on this exam that we do not expect you to be able to do based only on what we've taught you over the summer; those questions have been included so we can figure out if there are students who have done lots of Python before MIDS. So do your best, but don't worry if there are questions you can't do! \n",
    "\n",
    "That also means that if you don't know how to do something, **please don't spend all your time trying to figure it out!**. There *will* be questions you don't know how to do, so when you find one, just move on!"
